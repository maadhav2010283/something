<h1> Welcome to Visual studio or VS </h1>
<h4> You can search up Visual studio on a search engine and download it. You have to download the go live feature. Once you do that you are all set and you have Visual studio or VS for short. </h4>
<h4> There is a thing called a console log which you can use by right clicking on the project and going to console. You can use the console log to print messages by doing console.log(whatever you want to put) </h4>
